## About the App

This application is a card game where players draw cards with the goal of getting as close to a total of 25 without going over. The game starts with a shuffled deck of cards. Players, which can include a mix of humans and computers, take turns drawing a card from the deck. The drawn card's value is added to the player's total score and displayed on the screen. If a player's total score exceeds 25, they lose. Once all cards are drawn, or all players have ended their turns, the player with the score closest to 25 without going over wins. If there's a tie, the player with more cards wins. The game includes features to draw a card, display the current highest score, and reset the game.
